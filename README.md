### Dynamic Pricing Model

Offlined, prices fluctuated based on demand and supply. I think it would be interesting to see a simulation of this effect online where supply is unlimited. 
 
This is the beginnings of a script tht will _fake_ limited supply. The idea is that prices should increase when demand increases and vice versa. 

To use, just run this in terminal

`git clone https://github.com/mehulkar/dynamic-pricing.git && cd dynamic-pricing && open index.html`
