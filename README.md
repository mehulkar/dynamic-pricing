### Dynamic Pricing Model

In the real world, prices fluctuated based on simple demand-and-supply economics. A basic Economics 101 class will teach you that this is because of limited supply and unlimited demand. 

In the digital world, there is no such thing as limited supply, i.e. you can download a song or transfer an image as many times as you want without diminishing the value of each copy. 

This is the beginnings of a script tht will _fake_ limited supply. The idea is that prices should increase when demand increases and vice versa. 

I don't think there is a business model here. But I think it's a cool thing to play around with. If you like what I'm doing, by all means, tweet me about it at [@mehulkar](http://twitter.com/mehulkar).
